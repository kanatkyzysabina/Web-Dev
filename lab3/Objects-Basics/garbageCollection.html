        main concept of memory management 
        in JavaScript is reachability.
        reachable values are those thata re acceessible or usable somehow

        There’s a background process in the JavaScript engine 
        that is called garbage collector. 
        It monitors all objects and removes those that have 
        become unreachable!
        simple example: */
        let user = {name: "John"};
        // user references name, if name is overwritten -> 
        // ref is lost - it becomes unreachable

        // Internal algorithms:
        // basic garbage collection algorithm is called 
        // “mark-and-sweep”.
        /*
        Garbage collection in JS is optimized to be fast
        Main optimizations:
        - Generational collection: New objects are checked more often because most of them are used briefly. 
          Objects that live longer are checked less often.
        - Incremental collection: Memory is cleaned in small parts instead of all at once, so there are no big pauses.
        - Idle-time collection: Garbage collection runs when the CPU is not busy.
