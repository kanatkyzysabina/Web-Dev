        <h1>Remember You</h1>
        <p> Marceline, <br>
        is it just you and me in <br>
        the wreckage of the world? <br>
        That must be so confusing <br>
        for a little girl <br>
        And I know you're going <br>
        to need me here with you <br>
        But I'm losing myself, <br>
        and I'm afraid you're going to lose me too <br>
        <br>
        This magic keeps me alive,<br>
        but it's making me crazy <br>
        And I need to save you, <br>
        but who's going to save me? <br>
        Please forgive me for whatever I do <br>
        When I don't remember you <br>
    </p>
    </body>
